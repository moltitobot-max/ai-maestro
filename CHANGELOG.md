Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.24.10] - 2026-02-20

### Changed
- Plugin submodule updated: `aimaestro-agent.sh` CLI split into 6 focused modules (agent-core, agent-commands, agent-session, agent-skill, agent-plugin + thin dispatcher)

## [0.24.9] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **OpenClaw agents as first-class citizens** — Auto-register OpenClaw agents in the agent registry on discovery, enabling AMP messaging, kanban task assignment, and team meeting participation
- Auto-query working directory from OpenClaw tmux sessions via `display-message`
- Auto-initialize AMP home directory and set `AMP_DIR`, `AIM_AGENT_NAME`, `AIM_AGENT_ID` environment variables in OpenClaw tmux sessions
- Session name validation (`/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/`) for OpenClaw-discovered sessions to prevent path traversal

### Changed
- AMP initialization only runs on first agent registration (not every poll cycle)
- Plugin submodule updated: `CLAUDE_AGENT_*` env vars renamed to `AIM_AGENT_*` with backward compatibility fallback
- Plugin README consolidated from root + plugin into single comprehensive document

### Fixed
- CI build: create `data/` directory before touch in workflow

## [0.24.8] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **OpenClaw tmux session discovery** — Detect agents running in OpenClaw's custom tmux sockets at `/tmp/clawdbot-tmux-sockets/`

### Fixed
- Double-paste on desktop terminals (Cmd+V fired both custom handler and native paste event)
- Outdated `pm2 start server.mjs` examples in OPERATIONS-GUIDE.md

### Changed
- Made `tsx` a production dependency (was devDependency — `yarn install --production` would break)

## [0.24.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Service layer architecture** — 23 service files, all ~100 API routes are thin wrappers
- **Headless mode** (`MAESTRO_MODE=headless`) — API-only server, no Next.js, ~1s startup
- Headless router serving all endpoints via standalone HTTP router
- Shared state bridge pattern (`globalThis._sharedState`) for server.mjs/API route interop
- `ServiceResult<T>` return type across all services
- 486 tests (281 service tests + 205 existing)
