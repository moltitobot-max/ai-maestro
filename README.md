# AI Maestro

*I was running 35 AI agents across multiple terminals and became the human mailman between them. So I built AI Maestro.*

**Orchestrate your AI coding agents from one dashboard — with persistent memory, agent-to-agent messaging, and multi-machine support.**

## The Story

I gave an AI agent a real task — not autocomplete, a real engineering problem. It checked the code, read the logs, queried the database, and came back with the answer. That was the moment. *This thing can actually work.*

Within a week I was running 35 agents across terminals. They were productive, but they couldn't talk to each other. I became the human message bus — copying context from one terminal, pasting into another. I was the bottleneck in my own AI team.

**So I built AI Maestro** — one dashboard to see every agent, on every machine, with persistent memory and direct agent-to-agent communication. Today I run 80+ agents across multiple computers, building real companies with them every day.

**What makes this different:**
- **Works with any AI agent** — Claude Code, Aider, Cursor, Copilot, your own scripts. We don't lock you in.
- **Multi-machine from day one** — Peer mesh network with no central server. Nobody else does this.
- **Agents that communicate** — The Agent Messaging Protocol (AMP) lets agents coordinate directly. You orchestrate, they collaborate.

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/23blocks-OS/ai-maestro/main/scripts/remote-install.sh | sh
```

This installs everything you need:
- AI Maestro dashboard and service
- Agent messaging system (AMP)
- Claude Code plugin with 5 skills and 32 CLI scripts

**Time:** 5-10 minutes · **Requires:** Node.js 18+, tmux

<details>
<summary>Windows (WSL2) / Linux notes</summary>

**Windows:** Install WSL2 first, then run the curl command inside Ubuntu:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

[Full Windows guide](./docs/WINDOWS-INSTALLATION.md)

**Linux:** Ensure build tools are installed: `sudo apt install tmux build-essential`
</details>

<details>
<summary>Manual install</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/23blocks-OS/ai-maestro.git
cd ai-maestro
yarn install
yarn dev
```

See [QUICKSTART.md](./docs/QUICKSTART.md) for detailed setup options.

Dashboard opens at `http://localhost:23000`

## Features

Every feature was born from a real problem. We built them in the order we needed them.

### One Dashboard

*I had 35 terminals and couldn't tell which was which.*

See and manage all your AI agents in one place. Create agents from the UI, organize them with smart naming (`project-backend-api` becomes a 3-level tree with auto-coloring), and switch between any agent with a click. Auto-discovers your existing tmux sessions.

### Any Machine

*My Mac Mini was sitting there idle. What if I ran agents on that too?*

A peer mesh network where every machine is equal. Add a computer, it joins the mesh. Every agent on every machine, visible from one dashboard. Use each machine for what it's best at — Mac for iOS builds, Linux for Docker, cloud for heavy compute. **No central server required.**

### Agent Messaging

*I was the mailman — copying messages between agents because they couldn't talk to each other.*

The [Agent Messaging Protocol (AMP)](https://agentmessaging.org) gives your agents email-like communication. Priority levels, message types, cryptographic signatures, and push notifications. Tell your agent *"send a message to backend about the deployment"* — it just works. Agents coordinate directly while you manage the big picture.

**Before AMP:** You copy research from one terminal, paste into another, repeat 50 times a day.
**With AMP:** *"Research agent, send your findings to the writing agent."* Done.

### Gateways

*A friend in Singapore wanted his agents to talk to mine. But I didn't want to give him access to my network.*

Connect your AI agents to [Slack](https://github.com/23blocks-OS/aimaestro-gateways), Discord, Email, and WhatsApp through organizational gateways. Smart routing (`@AIM:agent-name`), thread-aware responses, and content security with 34 prompt injection patterns detected at the gateway — before any agent sees the message.

### Persistent Memory

*Every morning, my agents woke up with amnesia.*

Three layers of intelligence that grow over time: **Memory** (agents remember past conversations and decisions), **Code Graph** (interactive visualization of your entire codebase with delta indexing), and **Documentation** (auto-generated, searchable docs from your code). Agents get smarter the longer they work with you.

### Work Coordination

*Talking isn't working. I needed agents to coordinate on actual deliverables.*

Assemble agents into teams, run meetings in split-pane war rooms, and track tasks on a full Kanban board with drag-and-drop, dependencies, and 5 status columns. Cross-machine teams work seamlessly. This is project management for your AI workforce.

### Agent Identity

*At 80 agents, they all looked the same.*

Custom avatars, personality profiles, and visual presence for every agent. When an agent has a face and a role, you instinctively assign it the right work — just like a real team.

## Who Is This For

**Developers running multiple AI agents.** If you have 3+ agents and you're switching between terminals, losing context, and playing messenger — this is for you. Works with Claude Code, Aider, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or any terminal-based AI.

**Teams coordinating AI-assisted work.** Multiple developers, multiple agents, multiple machines. One dashboard. Agent-to-agent messaging replaces you as the bottleneck.

**Creators and operators** who want to connect AI agents to the outside world through Slack, Discord, or Email — without exposing their infrastructure.
